## js variables and data types
JavaScript provides eight different data types which are 
- undefined
- null
- boolean
- string
- symbol
- bigint
- number
- object.
```
var myName;
```
* js variables are case sensitive. And should be write in camelCase form.
* var vs let vs const
- var: Can declare multi variables in same name. And last one is overwrite it's value of above one.
- let: Can't declare variable by same name. It's show an error message in console.
- const: once a variable is assigned with `const`, it cannot be reassigned(value).
